  <p >
   <ul> As a citizen of India, you have several fundamental rights guaranteed by
    the Indian Constitution. </ul><br /><br /> <u>These rights include:</u> <br><br>
    <b style="color:rgb(242, 255, 0);">Right to Equality:</b> This ensures equal treatment before the law
    and prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or
    place of birth. <br /><br />
    <b style="color:rgb(242, 255, 0);">Right to Freedom:</b> This includes freedom of speech and expression,
    freedom of assembly, freedom to form associations or unions, freedom of
    movement throughout the territory of India, freedom to reside and settle
    in any part of India, and freedom to practice any profession,
    occupation, trade, or business. <br /><br />
    <b style="color:rgb(242, 255, 0);">Right Against Exploitation:</b> This prohibits trafficking, forced
    labor, and child labor. <br /><br />
    <b style="color:rgb(242, 255, 0);">Right to Freedom of Religion:</b> You have the right to freely
    profess, practice, and propagate religion, subject to public order,
    morality, and health. <br /><br />
    <b style="color:rgb(242, 255, 0);">Cultural and Educational Rights:</b> This ensures the protection of
    interests of minorities, including their right to establish and
    administer educational institutions of their choice.
    <br />
    <br /><b style="color:rgb(242, 255, 0);">Right to Constitutional Remedies:</b> This enables citizens to
    move the court if they believe their fundamental rights have been
    violated. The courts can issue writs like habeas corpus, mandamus,
    prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto to enforce these rights.
    <br /><br />
    Additionally, India also provides certain other rights to its citizens,
    including the right to education, right to information, and right to
    work. These rights are aimed at ensuring the welfare and well-being of
    all citizens.
